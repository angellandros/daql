[1mCanon PowerShot G1 X 14.3 MP CMOS Digital Camera[0m
The Pinnacle of PowerShotBright  fast and more creative than ever  advanced technologies come together for an exciting new camera that moves beyond anything the G Series has seen before  The PowerShot G1 X digital camera will inspire advanced amateurs who have embraced the G Series to explore new realms of photographic expression  and give pros an excellent camera that complements their creative demands The new 1 5 inch High Sensitivity CMOS sensor approaches DSLR size  with a light sensitive area that rsquo s approximately 6 3 times larger than that of the PowerShot G12 digital camera  The new 14 3 Megapixel sensor  combined with a new lens and DIGIC 5 Image Processor  creates the HS SYSTEM that delivers image quality previously impossible in a compact camera  with beautiful blur  lower noise  and extraordinary resolution in low light shooting and can shoot at ISOs of up to 12800  The PowerShot G1 X also has 14 bit RAW capabilities for even greater creative control and Full HD Video recording  Manual settings and operability inherited from EOS cameras impart a high level shooting experience  and open the door to new creative possibilities  Substantive luxury defines the design  a neatly clarified sculpture with a firm grip  huge Vari angle LCD and optical viewfinder Canon DIGIC 5 Image ProcessorThe latest generation Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor brings phenomenal increases in processing speed and power  Improved chip architecture and algorithms deliver greatly expanded functionality with further refinement in image quality  Improved noise reduction produces clearer images when shooting in low light at high ISO speeds  Enhanced i Contrast performance adjusts differences between light and dark areas to achieve even more natural looking results  The faster processing speed also results in faster continuous shooting capability  The DIGIC 5 Image Processor also makes possible a new  highly advanced automatic white balance system  Whereas conventional white balance makes an overall adjustment based on a single type of light source  the new Canon Multi Area White Balance analyzes several areas of the image to determine whether different adjustments are needed  for example  for the main subject and the background Canon 1 5 inch  14 3 Megapixel High Sensitivity CMOS SensorCanon engineers developed a sensor for PowerShot G1 X digital camera that is nearly the size of an EOS DSLR camera rsquo s APS C sized sensor  and built with a similar pixel structure mdash each pixel site is larger  allowing more light to be captured mdash giving the PowerShot G1 X a completely different level of image quality than compact cameras that have come before it  At 1 5 inches  the sensor is approximately 6 3 times larger than that of the PowerShot G12 digital camera  This heightened degree of sensitivity  along with 14 3 Megapixels  delivers several distinct advantages  Noise is dramatically reduced at high ISO speeds for clear low light and nighttime shooting  Resolution at low ISO speeds is incredibly rich and precise  And  most atypically for a compact camera  the PowerShot G1 X digital camera allows you to create the intensely beautiful background blur that is the hallmark of DSLR cameras  nbsp Canon HS SYSTEMThe Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright  clear photos in an even wider range of shooting situations Beautiful low light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas  The system is the result of two technologies brought together in PowerShot cameras  a high sensitivity imaging sensor  which is able to capture more light  and the DIGIC Image Processor  which actively reduces noise with high speed image processing  The 14 3 Megapixel Canon CMOS sensor in the PowerShot G1 X incorporates advanced light reception technology that enhances sensitivity  The new DIGIC 5 Image Processor provides a major boost in noise reduction  expanding the usable range to an amazingly high ISO 12800  The HS SYSTEM thus lets you use higher shutter speeds to capture clearer images with reduced noise and blur Shooting and Recording Modes Including 14 bit RAW   JPEGThe PowerShot G1 X offers a host of shooting and recording modes ranging from fully automatic to fully manual  plus Full HD movies and full resolution High Speed Burst HQ at a maximum of 6 frames   The camera recognizes 32 shooting situations  automatically optimizing settings for achieving the highest quality shots on the go  Alternatively  you can exert complete creative control over the look and feel of your images  14 bit signal processing  just as in EOS series cameras  gives images notably rich detail and smooth gradation  Compared with 12 bit processing  14 bit offers a 4x increase in RAW data  makes a visible impact  giving images rich detail in both highlights and shadows as well as smoother  more natural tonal gradation for outstanding image quality  Continuous shooting speed is 4 5 fps Canon Full HD Video Advantage  x2028 In addition to the HS SYSTEM  the combination of the advanced CMOS sensor and DIGIC 5 Image Processor in the PowerShot G1 X digital camera makes it possible to shoot crisp  clear high definition video  Imagine the fun and excitement of being able to shoot spectacular 1080p Full HD video with stereo sound that you can later watch on your HDTV or download to your computer to share with family and friends  In addition to being able to shoot Full HD 1080p video at 24  frames per second  the PowerShot G1 X digital camera can also shoot 720p HD video at 30   frames per second  Actual frame rate is 23 976 fps   Actual frame rate is 29 97 fps Dedicated Movie Button  Wind filter feature and Optical Zoom for easy video captureIt rsquo s never been easier to shoot videos with a PowerShot digital camera  The PowerShot G1 X has a dedicated moviebutton that lets you start and stop recording instantly  There is no need to go through layers of menus or operate switches or dials to switch to and from video recording mode  The camera is always ready to shoot stills or video whenever you want  The PowerShot G1 X also incorporates an electronic wind filter  which suppresses wind noise that can muffle or distort the sound  And unlike less sophisticated point and shoot cameras  the PowerShot G1 X lets you use the full range of optical zoom when you rsquo re shooting a video HDTV Playback via HDMI with CEC SupportIt rsquo s easy to enjoy and share the videos you shoot with the PowerShot G1 X  Simply connect its HDMI terminal to your HDTV using an HDMI cable  And because the PowerShot G1 X supports HDMI CEC technology  you rsquo ll be able to control the playback of your images and videos on any CEC enabled HDTV using the TV rsquo s remote control   CEC  ndash  Consumer Electronic Control  ndash  is part of the HDMI specification  enabling components in a system to communicate with one another

A wide angle  zoom lens with high resolution and brightness  Features a circular iris with excellent defocusing characteristics and Advanced Distance Integration  ADI  for enhanced flash shooting performance About the Dynax Lens SystemAspherical Lenses  Minolta retains a distinct advantage in the use of aspherical optics  With ordinary spherical lenses  the focal point varies according to whether the incident light passes through the central or peripheral part of the lens  thus producing spherical aberration  While perfect compensation has never been achieved  and is particularly difficult to compensate for in large diameter lenses  decreasing the lens curve or combining dispersion lenses are methods commonly used in an attempt to compensate for spherical aberration  Minolta s aspherical lenses are developed not only to correct spherical aberration in large diameter lenses  but also to take high contrast images with less blotting effects while in the largest aperture  Minolta s aspherical lenses are effective in correcting distortion while using wide and standard zooms  What s more  the use of aspherical lenses decreases the total number of lenses required to produce a complete lens This technology has enabled Minolta to create more compact lenses AD Glass  AD  Anomalous Dispersion  glass decreases chromatic aberration more than normal optical glass  to prevent a decrease in resolving power which occurs when the focal length increases  The unique AD glass developed by Minolta enables vivid reproductions when using large diameter telephoto lenses and telephoto zoom lenses Circular 7  or 9 Blade Aperture  The closer the aperture shape is to becoming a perfect circle  the more beautiful your defocused effect will be  That s why Minolta s specially designed aperture blades produce a circular opening from their widest setting down 1 5 steps to help smooth a scene s out of focus areas  When you take a picture with sunlight shining through foliage  a picture at sunset or a picture of neon lights  the source of the light can be defocused beautifully  The number of aperture blades must be maximized to make the aperture as perfectly circular as possible  Conversely  each blade can be curved to produce a circular aperture  and thus a desired blurring effect

[1mBushnell ImageView 10x25 VGA Digital Camera Binocular[0m
Combining a pair of binoculars with a digital camera is a brilliant idea with endless possibilities  with useful applications from birdwatchers documenting their greatest  catches  to parents zooming in on their kids on the playing field  Unfortunately  Bushnell  x92 s Imageview digital binoculars  which integrate digital imaging into a pair of 10x25 binoculars  may be ahead of their time The image quality of the binoculars isn  x92 t a problem  as they employ clear optics that allow for sharp focusing at the fixed 10x zoom level  Build quality also is good  with thick rubber coating on the sides to ensure a good grip and fold down rubber eyecups to accommodate eyeglass wearers  The small 25mm objective lenses  however  don  x92 t provide substantial light gathering but do keep the design as small and light as possibleThe built in camera will be the real problem for most users  It uses a low resolution CCD that snaps pictures at a fixed resolution of 640 x 480  which is fine for e mail but not adequate for making prints  To make matters worse  most of the shots we took were grainy  with lots of compression artifacts and subpar color If you can live with those limitations  the camera does have the benefits of ease of use and plenty of image storaging capacity  With 8 MB of built in memory  we snapped nearly 150 pictures before connecting the camera to a PC  No image preview is available  but a basic black and white LCD display on top of the camera tells you how many pictures you  x92 ve snapped and the selected mode With a better digital camera and removable memory slots  this idea of a high quality camera binocular hybrid could realize its full potential  However  the image quality compromises imposed by the Imageview will be too much for many to bear  regardless of the low price   T  Byrl BakerPros Compact binocularsCamera is easy to use and doesn  x92 t require two handsStores nearly 150 pictures in internal memoryCons Low picture qualityNo direct image preview or management25mm objective lens means you need a lot of light to get the most out of the binoculars
